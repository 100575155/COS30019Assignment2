(-----------------Delete this before submission---------------------------------)
You must include a single readme.txt file with your work with the following details:
? Student Details: Your full student names, ids, and your group number (as allocated by ESP).
? Features/Bugs/Missing: Include a list of the features you have implemented. Clearly state if a
required feature has not been implemented. Failure to do this will result in penalties. Include a list of
any known bugs.
? Test cases: The test cases you have developed ton test your program. What bugs have you found?
? Acknowledgements/Resources: Include in your readme.txt file a list of the resources you have
used to create your work. A simple list of URL's is not enough. Include with each entry a basic
description of how the person or website assisted you in your work.
? Notes: Anything else you want to tell the marker, such as how to use the GUI version of your
program, and something particular about your implementation.
? Summary report: Summary of the teamwork in this assignment. You need to clearly indicate who
did what and how each team member gave feedback to other members. In this report, the overall
percentage of contribution by each student to the project has to be clearly specified and summed to
100%.

Assignment 2 Report:

Student Detais:
- Name: Lachie Hines ID: 101106161
- Name: Bayley Papworth ID: 101102583
- Name: Anthony Tran ID: 100575155
Group ID:
- COS30019_A02_T032

Features/Bugs/Missing:
- Required features added:
  - Forward Chaining: 
    - Forward Chaining is implemented and working as we intended. It takes in the test file 
      displays the correct output. (anyother other notes) <----- (anthony)

  - Backward Chaining:  
    - (summarize work/code) <----- (baylay)

- Required features missing:
  - Truth Table:
    - An attempt at truth tables was made although now working method is implemented. 
      We looked at 2 possible ways to implement the Truth Table method and both ways 
      are included in the ziped file. The first is the TT-Entails and TT-Check functions
      found via our research. This method looked to work tell although since we didn't 
      design the code ourselves we ran into problems enchancing it and applying it to the
      problem. So ultimately we stopped working on that and started from scratch. Our
      understanding of the TT-Entails method is noted in comments in that file. We then 
      started working on our second file (TruthTableNew). Having started later then desired
      on this option limited process was made into its application. Again comments are listed
      in the file to show our understanding. 

- Bugs:
  - Sanitize (elaborate on bugs <------- (anyone)
  - 

Test Cases: Working with different KB and Q? <----- write test cases (anyone)
- test1 (deafult)
  - Tell: p2=> p3; p3 => p1; c => e; b&e => f; f&g => h; p1=>d; p1&p3 => c; a; b; p2; 
  - Ask: d

Acknowledgements/Resources/Research:
- "TextBook"<----- input text book name (either)
  - The textbook helped in regard to Forward and Backwards chaining methods as it listed examples
    of code to follow when implementing the methods.

- TT Entails example from GitHub:
  "https://github.com/chris-verclytte/aimaSudokuSolving/blob/master/aima-core/src/main/java/aima/core/logic/
   propositional/inference/TTEntails.java"
  - For the first attempt at Truth Tables this example helped to give an explanation on how to 
    implement the Truth Table method and a good explanation of the code to follow.

- external libraires
  - in the code the use of external libraires helps in implement the various methods. <------ add librarires used in code (either)

- Anyone other acknowledgments??
  - <---------- (either)(delete this if not)

Notes:
- In regards to Truth Table implementation
  - Due to time contraints and struggle to understand and find help on the implmentation of Truth Table
    algorithim the final Truth Table Submission is below standard. Attmempts and process of implementation 
    listed above in (Missing Features)

- Anyone other notes??
  - <---------- (either)(delete this if not)

Summary:
- Work Allocation
  - Lachie (Contribution Percentage = 30%)
    - Feedback: The only feedback I gave the other group members was to ensure that their code
                followed the outline of the assignment critera.

    - Complete work: Truth Table, Report, Main Sanitize inputs, error debugging, 

  - Bayley (Contribution Percentage = 35%)
    - Feedback: <------- write feed back youve given (Baylay)

    - Complete work: Backwards Chaining, Data Structure, Createproblem method in main, error debugging

  - Anthony (Contribution Percentage = 35%)
    - Feedback: (<------- write feed back youve given (Anthony)

    - Complete work: Forwards Chaining, Input for File and method selection in main, fixing sanitize regex, error debugging set up GitHub,
